![Design preview for the Entertainment web app coding challenge](./src/assets/preview.jpg)

## Intro

Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out my solution to the [Entertainment web app challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/entertainment-web-app-J-UhgAW1X) from Frontend Mentor. ðŸ˜€

Feel free to look around and explore! ðŸ˜‰

## Overview

I went to the extra mile and build a full stack web app.

For the front end I used:

- TypeScript and React;
- Sass;
- Redux.

For the back end I used:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB.

As a user you can:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size;
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page;
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages;
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series;
- Search for relevant shows on all pages;
- Log in and log out;
- Register as a new user.
